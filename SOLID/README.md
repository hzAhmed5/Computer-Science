## SOLID

A set of principles recommended to follow in order to maintain business applications. Contains examples of both convinient and unconviniet examples

* **Single Responsibility Principle** - `Do one thing, but do it best`
* **Open-Closed Principle** - `App. should be open for extension, but closed for modification`. Usually, solved by pattern `Strategy`
* **Liskov Substitution Principle** - `Proper abstractization, where all subclasses correctly implements methods from base class`
* **Interface Segregation Principle** - `Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use.`
* **Dependency Inversion Principle**
  * `High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.`
  * `Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.`
